OOP change = 

For the OOP change I added a treasure so the player has another object to collect. 

My algorithmic change = 

1. Changed the number of baddies to 50

2. Changed the numbers so character doesn't go flying and bounces back down

3. Start at 50 enyms collected instead of one so you quickly get to know how many enyms you missed instead of doing subtraction

I changed the opening and closing scene so I like the colors
